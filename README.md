# Overview

This program is designed to interact with a cloud database and give approved users the ability to create, modify, delete and view a table in a database. 

This program was made to give easy access to store details of my run to the cloud.

# Cloud Database

The cloud database I am using is Firestore which is an extension of Firebase which allows for using Firebase's user auth to require an account to use it.

The database is using a dictionary structure with all the documents having values for the different elements of time, distance, and name.

# Development Environment

I used visual studio code and FireBase to develop this database software.

The programming language used to create this software was python and the firebase-admin and pyrebase libraries.

# Future Work

* Improve the display of the table to remove the dictionary formatting.
* Improve the user auth system to allow for them to make entries just for them and only have access to see those entries.
